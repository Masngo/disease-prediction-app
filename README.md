# disease-prediction-app
This is a comprehensive, end-to-end machine learning-based application for disease prediction. It leverages Python and Flask to create a web-based interface that utilizes a trained machine learning model to predict diseases based on a patient's symptoms. The project demonstrates a full MLOps pipeline, from data preparation and model training.
